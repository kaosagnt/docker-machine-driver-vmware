# ⚠️This is a fork of Docker Machine VMware Driver ⚠

This is a fork of [Docker Machine VMware Driver](https://github.com/machine-drivers/docker-machine-driver-vmware) 
maintained for [Toolbox2docker](https://github.com/kaosagnt/toolbox2docker).

Changes include:
- updated to compile against GO 1.21.x and later.
- Uses github\kaosagnt\docker-machine with updates and changes.
- Inital support to build inside a Docker Container.

TODO: fix documentation and Docker build support

# Docker Machine VMware Driver

Create Docker machines locally on VMware [Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion)
and [Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation).

This driver requires VMware Workstation 14 (Windows/Linux) or VMware Fusion 10 (macOS)
to be installed on your host. Earlier versions of Workstation/Fusion might still work
with this driver, but it's not officially supported.

>
> Docker machine has a builtin driver called `vmwarefusion`. The main difference between
> those drivers is that `vmware` also works on VMware Workstation, while `vmwarefusion` only
> works on VMware Fusion.
